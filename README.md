# QC-Debug
Repo to fix OSX Quartz Composer bugs

It seems quartz composer gets attention in development again,
so it is important to have a propper collection of known bugs
and until they may fanish away to have workarounds. 


you can report issues

mention: This is not an origami focused repository, so if you want to report general bugs found in quartz composer or you may know how to come around and want to share it, you are very welcome.
For reporting origami bugs or if you want report errors who interfere by third party plugins, please report at corresponding pages their creators to give them chance to fix it.


**Structure**
for obvious reason, it makes sens to have not only workarounds to come around known buggy behaviour, it is a lot easier to have propper testcases to proof a bug is still existing or hopefully gone in development of QC.
If you are able to show error points please try to create test cases (qtz files) where bugs can be proofen in isolated form.
